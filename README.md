# Semi-Global Matching (8-direction)
A Matlab implementation of Semi-Global Matching (SGM) for stereo matching.
It uses the 8-direction version of the algorithm with a small improvement for better results.
The improvement is that in the calculation of the total cost, the matching cost does not add up (normally it had to add up once for each direction).
